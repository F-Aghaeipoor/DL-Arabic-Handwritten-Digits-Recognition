# Arabic Handwritten Digits Recognition/Generation

The motivation of this repo is to use cross knowledge learned from multiple works to enhance the performance of Arabic handwritten digits recognition. In recent years, Arabic handwritten digits recognition with different handwriting styles as well, making it important to find and work on a new and advanced solution for handwriting recognition. In addition, several GAN models are applied to output new examples of Arabic handwritten digits.

# Data
The MADBase is modified Arabic handwritten digits database contains 60,000 training images, and 10,000 test images. MADBase were written by 700 writers. Each writer wrote each digit (from 0 -9) ten times, avatlable in https://www.kaggle.com/mloey1/ahdd1

# Testing Recognition model in the GUI
The trained model can be tested using some real handwritten digits as follows:
