# Data-Science-Arabic-Handwritten-Digits-Recognition

# Context

The motivation of this study is to use cross knowledge learned from multiple works to enhancement the performance of Arabic handwritten digits recognition. In recent years, Arabic handwritten digits recognition with different handwriting styles as well, making it important to find and work on a new and advanced solution for handwriting recognition. A deep learning systems needs a huge number of data (images) to be able to make a good decisions.

# Data

The MADBase is modified Arabic handwritten digits database contains 60,000 training images, and 10,000 test images. MADBase were written by 700 writers. Each writer wrote each digit (from 0 -9) ten times, avatlable in https://www.kaggle.com/mloey1/ahcd1

# Training 

Model Training has been be carried out in kaggle notebooks (to avoid data uploading and downloading) as can be seen in https://www.kaggle.com/fatemefateme/arabic-handwritten-digits-recognition/edit/run/59320770

# Testing in a GUI
The trained model can be tested using some real handwritten digits as follows:
